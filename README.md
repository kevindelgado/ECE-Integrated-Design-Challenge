===============================

Arduino code for the robot my team and I buit for the Integrated Design Challenge of our Fundamentals of Electrical and Computer Engineering course from Spring 2014

Our task was to built a robot using the Arduino MEGA2560 microcontroller, Parallax BOE-Bot, and various sensors, that could follow a black line on a white surface along with detect what color is beneath it and communicate information to the other robots on the course.
